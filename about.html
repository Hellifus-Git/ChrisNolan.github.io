      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a Technical Designer, currently working at Ghost Story Games. I am implementing the dynamic encounter
        system that will populate all the spaces across the game.
        I am passionate about making games, playing games, but I also have many hobbies outside of gaming.
        Some of those hobbies include hiking, camping, and shooting. I'm always learning new things and love to 
        figure out how to implement tech and features I've never done before.</p>
